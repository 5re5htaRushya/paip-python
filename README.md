paip-python
===========

Python implementations of the classic AI programs from Peter Norvig's fantastic
textbook "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming."


## Overview

This is meant to be a learning resource for beginning AI programmers.  It is no
longer common for students to have a background in Lisp programming, as many
universities have replaced Lisp with other languages in introductory programming
and introductory artificial intelligence courses.  It is my hope that making the
programs from PAIP available in a commonly-taught language will provide a useful
hands-on resource for beginning AI students.

I am writing these programs while reading through PAIP, so consider this a work
in progress.  Additionally, I am not at this time focusing on the end-of-chapter
exercises, which typically propose extensions to the programs to avoid various
limitations.  I hope that these Python programs are clean translations and don't
try to force Lisp idioms onto Python.

You can follow the progress of the project on [Trello][].


## Running

- You need [Python 2.7][]
- [Download][] the paip-python code.
- Type `python run_examples.py` and follow the prompts to run the examples.
- To use the Prolog interpreter, run `python prolog.py`.  There are some
  example databases in `paip/examples/prolog` which can be loaded with the
  option `--db`, e.g. `python prolog.py --db paip/examples/prolog/graph.prolog`.


## Documentation

Literate programming-style documentation is autogenerated and available in the
docs/ subdirectory.  There is a page for each AI module that describes usage,
gives an overview of the solution, and documents the implementation.


## About

These programs were written by [Daniel Connelly][homepage] as an independent
project supervised by [Professor Ashok Goel][goel].
